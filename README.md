# CTA-Tracker-App
1. Uses Core Location to determine the current location and display the location on a
map. Displays the information that is most relevant to the userâ€™s current location in
the app, e.g., near-by stations and approaching trains and buses to these stations.
2. Dynamically updates and adjusts the display of information of near-by stations and the
upcoming trains or buses as the user approaches a train or bus station. Imagine that
you are walking around the loop, every block or so there are new bus or train stations.
3. Uses the location simulation feature to test the app by creating a simulated route in a
GPX file. Adds the GPX file to a run scheme in Xcode to test the app.
4. The app is robust. When errors or anomalies are encountered during the
communication or in the data content, it can continue to function to the
best possible extent by providing appropriate messages, responses, and the best
available information in the UI.
